"""
    Moves .txt files in the specified base directory into folders with the same name as the file (without the extension).

    Parameters:
    base_dir (str): The path to the base directory containing the .txt files.

    Process:
    - Lists all .txt files in the base directory.
    - For each .txt file, extracts the file name without the extension to use as the folder name.
    - Creates a new folder with the same name as the file (if it doesn't already exist).
    - Moves the .txt file into the corresponding folder.

    Example:
    Given a base directory with files "example.txt" and "test.txt":
    - "example.txt" will be moved to a folder named "example".
    - "test.txt" will be moved to a folder named "test".
